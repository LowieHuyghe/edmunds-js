Edmunds is an Express based framework for building web applications
with a firm structure to start from. Edmunds takes away the pain of
bootstrap code so you can kickoff with the things that really
matter.


## Getting Started

Create your new project by running the following command in your
terminal.

```bash
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/edmundsjs/edmunds/master/create-edmunds-app.sh)"
```

Then take a look at the rest of the documentation to get the hang of
it.
