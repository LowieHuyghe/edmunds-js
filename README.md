Edmunds is an Express based framework for building web applications
with a firm structure to start from. Edmunds takes away the pain of
bootstrap code so you can kickoff with the things that really
matter.

> Note: This repository contains the core code of the Edmunds
framework. You can visit the main
[Edmunds repository](https://github.com/edmundsjs/edmunds) too.
